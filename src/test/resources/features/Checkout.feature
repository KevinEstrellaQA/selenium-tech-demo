    Scenario Outline: Mandatory fields validation during checkout
      When I add one product to the cart
      And I click on the cart icon
      And I click on the checkout button
      And voy a checkout y dejo "<campo>" vac√≠o
      Then veo el error "<mensaje>"

        | campo        | mensaje                         |
        | First Name   | Error: First Name is required   |
